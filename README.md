# README mean-skeleton-2020

The purpose of this project is to provide a skeleton framework for using the MEAN stack in 2020, with up to date versions and everything working together.

This is meant to be a typical, familiar example of the MEAN stack that takes into account recent changes up to Feb 2020.  If you have any suggestions, pull requests are welcome - please keep them small and well commented so can I understand the request!
